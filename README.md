This code works with a collection of e-mail data downloadable from: https://snap.stanford.edu/data/email-EuAll.txt.gz The data forms a graph G of e-mails between users, with each line being of the form sender receiver. The files compute the following on G:

• Number of nodes in the graph <br>
• Average (and median) indegree and out degree <br>
• Average (and median) number of nodes reachable in two hops <br>
• Number of nodes with indegree > 100
